# Email Configuration for Vercel Deployment

# Option 1: Resend (Recommended for Vercel)
# Sign up at https://resend.com and get your API key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here

# Option 2: Gmail (Fallback for local development)
# Replace with your actual email credentials
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Note: For Gmail, you'll need to use an App Password instead of your regular password
# To generate an App Password:
# 1. Go to your Google Account settings
# 2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
# 3. Go to Security > App passwords
# 4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
# 5. Use that password here instead of your regular Gmail password

# The contact form will automatically send notifications to: cong.yao.main@gmail.com
